\description{
`road_get_localities` fetches data of archaeological sites (localities) from ROAD database.
The ROAD table locality provides basic information about each place where an assemblage of
archaeological, paleoanthropological, paleontological, paleobotanical or other relevant materials
was described, recorded, sampled or collected. Every locality (site) is situated in a specific
country within a given geographic region. The name of every locality is unique.
}
\details{
Use parameters to filter search results by location, type, or culture or omit them to have a broader result set.
All parameters are optional and should be omitted or set to NULL when not used.
