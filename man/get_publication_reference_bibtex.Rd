Internal helper function that queries the ROAD database for all publications
associated with a single locality and formats them as BibTeX entries. The function
generates proper BibTeX entries for different publication types including books,
book chapters (inbook), journal articles, theses (PhD, Master's, Bachelor's),
and unpublished works.
}
\details{
The function automatically determines the correct BibTeX entry type
(\code{@book}, \code{@inbook}, \code{@article}, \code{@phdthesis}, 
\code{@mastersthesis}, \code{@bathesis}, \code{@unpublished})
based on publication metadata and includes all relevant fields such as author, title,
journal/booktitle, publisher, year, pages, volume, DOI, and editor.
