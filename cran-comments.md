* This is a new release.

* Note: This package build generated the warning "unable to verify current time." This is typically due to time zone or system clock differences during the build process. It does not affect the functionality of the package, and we believe it can be safely ignored.

* We have chosen the CC BY-SA 4.0 license for our package because it ensures compatibility with the related ROAD database. As a result, both the package and the data retrieved through it are made available under the same license, simplifying its use.

## Resubmission comments

* All examples were checked with the "tictoc" package and run in under five seconds on our local machines across different networks.

* We updated our SSL certificates to ensure safe network connections.

* The Word "ROCEEH" is not misspelled, but the Abbreviation of the Research Center "The Role of Culture in Early Expansions of Humans", which curates the "ROCEEH Out of Africa Database (ROAD)".

* The +LICENSE file was removed, because redundant.
